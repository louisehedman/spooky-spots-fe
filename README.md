## **About this project**

This is a school assignment for Fullstack Developer students at Chas Academy. The aim of the assignment was to go from an idea to a finished product with a code base in MERN-stack and TypeScript. The app's content is developed based on a user analysis, personas and user stories have their basis in the analysis. SpookySpots is the result. This is the frontend part of the project. This frontend is deployed at [Netlify](https://spookyspots.netlify.app/).

You find the backend source code (Node, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript) [here](https://github.com/louisehedman/spooky-spots-be) which is deployed at [Render](https://spooky-spots.onrender.com/). Instructions for how to set up the backend part of this project can be found in the backend repo.

## PWA
The whole app is a PWA supported by both Android and iOS. It can also be used offline since it's saving cache to use at such occasions, with some limitations in functionality as it cannot make calls to API in offline mode. The cache saving has benefits in online mode too, the app will load much faster.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
